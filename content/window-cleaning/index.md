Before we start any window cleaning work on your premises, we carry out a Dynamic Risk Assessment taking into consideration all the relevant working conditions, various appropriate types of access, any work at height requirements, necessary equipment, and other appropriate considerations. All staff will be briefed on the risks and methods involved signing the documents to say they fully understand whatâ€™s required. We are fully insured to protect you and your premises as well as ourselves.
