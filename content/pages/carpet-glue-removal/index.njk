<h1>Carpet glue removal</h1>

<p><strong>Carpet Glue removal</strong> - Here at Clearview we have developed a way of removing all the glue tackifier residue left from on the metal raised flooring. After removing the old carpet tiles, we are always left with the glue residue. We want to encourage landlords to reuse their old, raised flooring instead of replacing and sending to land fill. Instead of replacing them and throwing away your old ones, make the decision to clean and reuse, so many times we see companies replacing them for brand new tiles only for the new tenants to come in and cover them in carpet.</p>

<p><strong>Cost Advantage</strong> - the cost saving compared to replacing could be as much as 50%, not to mention the huge carbon saving. Polished floors can improve the attractiveness of the office space offering light and style to an office space to prospective clients.</p>

<p><strong>Urban Chic</strong> - Certainly, metal is not the first thing you think of when you think of floor tiles. But more widely it is being used in offices and left completely bare without carpet. The recycled metal, as well as being eco-friendly provides a host of practical benefits and gives the office its own unique style.</p>

<p><strong>Environmentally friendly</strong> - If your keen to be environmentally friendly and re-use your flooring whilst making you a big saving reuse raised flooring rather than it is entering into landfill.</p>

<p><strong>Time Saving</strong> - Construction companies are often restricted on time during fit-outs, by cleaning the tiles and not replacing we can save them valuable time to complete other tasks ready for handover.</p>
